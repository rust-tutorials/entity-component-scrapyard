<p>Hiiii person reading this. </p>
<p>EC-Scrapyard is a tutorial walkthrough thingy where we're going to write an ECS from scratch :3</p>
<p>This book is written with the assumption that the reader knows what an ECS is but not necessarily how it works or how to go about writing one. If
you dont know what an ECS is there's a good writeup <a href="https://www.google.com">here</a></p>
<p>A few caveats before we start:</p>
<ul>
<li>We wont be using any dependencies, we will be using rust's standard library though :&quot;)</li>
<li>We will only use safe code so <code>#![forbid(unsafe_code)]</code> will be placed at the top of <code>lib.rs</code></li>
<li>We wont touch on the Systems part of ECS because I personally feel that's better left to engines and users of the ECS to decide how best to structure the program</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of the ECS' in the rust ecosystem use something called 'archetypes' so we'll be writing an archetype based ECS in this book. If you dont know what archetypes are don't worry they'll be explained later on in the book when we get around to implementing them :) If you're impatient and want to look at it now you can go ahead and do that :P <a href="./archetype-explanation">the section for that is here</a></p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#a-basic-entity-generator" id="a-basic-entity-generator">A basic entity generator</a></h1>
<p>Lets start with implementing a basic struct that will let us spawn and despawn entities. Every ECS has something like this and by starting here we can make progress without tackling some of the harder stuff immediately :)</p>
<p>Every ECS that has performance as a goal will not store data *in* their Entity struct but 
will instead have the Entity be a handle to component data. This is because when we ask 
the ECS for all components <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> if they're stored in the Entity struct they'll 
never be in cache when we go to access them. (This also has many borrowck issues, maybe for another book though :&gt;)
Whereas if we store a bunch of our <code>T1</code> components in a Vec, when we iterate through it 
we'll end up having the next components loaded into cache which is far more efficient.</p>
<p>A simple way to implement this &quot;Entity as a handle&quot; thing would be to create a tuple struct that wraps a u32 or u64 or whatever size integer you want e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen">pub struct Entity(u64);
</code></pre>
<p>we could then add some derives</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen">#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]
pub struct Entity(u64);
</code></pre>
<p>This would work pretty well, entities would be cheap to copy, compare with eachother, 
and they're relatively small in size which is good because we'll have a *lot* of 
entities in our ECS. Sequential ids hopefully will also make the code for generating new 
ids not super complex, we just add 1 to a counter.<br />
The first entity we spawn is <code>Entity(0)</code> the second is <code>Entity(1)</code> the third <code>Entity(2)</code> etc etc etc</p>
<p>Well, lets try write up this entity spawning code and see if it ends up with any suprise complexity.
Lets start by making a struct with that counter and our spawn method that increments it</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen">struct EntityGenerator {
    next_id: u64,
}

impl EntityGenerator {
    fn spawn(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Entity {
        let entity = Entity(self.next_id);
        self.next_id += 1;
        entity
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Okay well thats not a lot of code although how exactly does <code>self.next_id += 1</code> handle 
the case where <code>self.next_id == u64::MAX</code> we're unlikely to ever have this many 
entities but we probably ought to atleast see what will happen...</p>
<p>(click the run button :3)</p>

<p>Oh, well that's not great...</p>
<p>We could explicitly use <code>wrapping_add</code> to avoid this panic, but then two calls to 
<code>EntityGenerator::spawn</code> could return the same entity and that's definitely undesirable. 
<code>u64::MAX</code> is a *really* big number so whether we panic or use <code>wrapping_add</code> is unlikely to make much of a difference.<br />
For this guide I'm just going to panic but if you want to wrapping_add that's also fine :)<br />
Note: overflow only panics in debug mode so if we want to panic on overflow we need to explicitly check for it</p>

</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we run this hopefully we panic with our new error message... </p>
<pre><code>thread 'main' panicked at 'Attempted to spawn an entity after running out of IDs'
</code></pre>
<p>Yep!</p>
<p>Okay the next thing we want to do is mark entities as dead, that's a pretty core thing for our ECS huh :P?<br />
We'll want a <code>despawn</code> function but how is this function even going to work? We cant store the 
dead/alive status on the Entity itself because we can copy an entity before it's despawned and then 
it would still think it's alive.<br />
We need to store all the despawned status of entities in our <code>EntityGenerator</code></p>
<p>There are a few options for this</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>Vec&lt;Entity&gt;</code> where we push dead entities to it, we would have to iterate the entire vec to 
check if an entity is dead which could be *super* slow so this is a non-starter.</li>
<li>A <code>Vec&lt;bool&gt;</code> which we index with the entity's u64 and set to true when we despawn the entity. 
This would be super fast to check if an entity is dead/alive, if you're concerned about 
ram consumption with this you could use a bitset instead which would have 1/8th the usage of <code>Vec&lt;bool&gt;</code></li>
<li>A <code>HashSet&lt;Entity&gt;</code> and we just insert dead entities into it. This would also be pretty fast to check if an entity is dead/alive</li>
</ul>
<p>Option #2 and #3 would both be valid choices but for this guide I'm going to go with the HashSet option because its simpler :) Option #2 should work well as a drop-in replacement for the hashset code though so feel free to do that on your own! :)</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-hashset-method" id="the-hashset-method">The Hashset method</a></h1>
<p>The code here will likely speak for itself so I'll just show it-</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen">struct EntityGenerator {
    next_id: u64,
    // New
    dead_entities: std::collections::HashSet&lt;Entity&gt;,

    fn despawn(&amp;mut self, entity: Entity) {
        self.dead_entities.insert(entity);

<span class="boring">        I like my ``== false`` okay
</span>        self.dead_entities.contains(&amp;entity) == false
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>At first glance this seems pretty correct right? but it isn't ^^&quot; there's an implicit assumption in this code that 
we only ever receive entities that were spawned from this <code>EntityGenerator</code> but we can just ignore that and cause
the generator to spawn a dead entity like so:</p>

<p>This is pretty problematic to say the least :P We can spawn entities with other generators, despawn them, and then spawn a dead entity. Looking back over our code with this in mind we can also see that if we call <code>is_alive</code> on an unspawned entity it would say yes... Soooooo how can we check for this?<br />
We could store another Hashet for every spawned entity but that would be really slow and waste memory, what's better is that we can compare <code>self.next_id</code> to the entity's <code>u64</code> to see if its indistinguishable from an entity spawned from this generator e.g.</p>

<p>I decided to <code>panic</code> in the <code>is_alive</code> method rather than <code>return false</code> because its pretty safe to say that it would be unintentional to do this so we should fail loudly to bring attention to it. It would also be completely fine to <code>return false</code> if you're opposed to panic'ing in libraries unnecessarily :)</p>
<p>To wrap this chapter up lets move all this code into a separate module, reexport the entity struct and then set everything to pub(crate) since we'll likely need this all elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now that we have entity spawning and despawning working it's about time to start storing some components, for that we need to learn about what archetypes are. Luckily that's exactly what the next chapter is for!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#what-are-archetypes" id="what-are-archetypes">What are archetypes?</a></h1>
<p>Archetypes are the underlying storage method we will be using to store components in our ECS. In 
our ECS we will use something like <code>Vec&lt;Archetype&gt;</code> to store everything.<br />
An archetype stores *all* of the components on an entity and also only stores components from entities 
with the same set of components. E.G. an entity with *only* <code>[T1, T2, T3]</code> components would
have all components stored in one archetype, and an entity with *only* <code>[T1, T2, T3, T4]</code> 
components would have all the components stored in a different archetype.</p>
<p>Let's say we have an archetype, we'll call it <code>A_123</code>. <code>A_123</code> is storing 
components for entities that only have components <code>[T1, T2, T3]</code>.<br />
When we spawn an entity like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen">world.spawn((
  T1 { .. },
  T2 { .. },
  T3 { .. },
));
</code></pre>
<p>We need to find an archetype to place all these components into. As mentioned previously we want to find if there's
an archetype that only stores components for entities with <code>[T1, T2, T3]</code>, and, luckily for us, there is! It's <code>A_123</code>.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at what <code>A_123</code> might look like internally and how we would go about placing these components into it.<br />
In psuedocode we have some archetype struct that looks a bit like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen">struct A_123 {
  column_1: Vec&lt;T1&gt;,
  column_2: Vec&lt;T2&gt;,
  column_3: Vec&lt;T3&gt;,
}
</code></pre>
<p>You might be wondering why we store each component type in a separate vec rather than something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen">struct A_123(Vec&lt;(T1, T2, T3)&gt;);
</code></pre>
<p>There are a few reasons for this,</p>
<ul>
<li>The borrow checker will get angry at us if we have two Query's where one wants to access components <code>T1</code> mutably and
the other wants to access <code>T2</code> immutably (We cant create an iterator over only *parts* of the (T1, T2, T3) tuple afterall)</li>
<li>It's more performant to store the components in separate Vecs as when we iterate only <code>T1</code> we dont needlessly load 
the <code>T2</code> and <code>T3</code> components into the cpu's cache.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that explained lets look at some psuedocode for that <code>spawn</code> function we used earlier.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen">fn spawn(&amp;mut self, data: (T1, T2, T3)) -&gt; Entity {
  let a_123 = /* magically get the A_123 archetype */;

  let entity = self.entity_generator.spawn();
  a_123.entities.push(entity);

  a_123.column_1.push(data.0);
  a_123.column_2.push(data.1);
  a_123.column_3.push(data.2);

  entity
}
</code></pre>
<p>...Huh interesting how all this psuedocode looks awfully like Rust... I'm sure its just a coincedence ;)</p>
<p>There are a few things to talk about the above code:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's this <code>entities</code> field that suddenly appeared?</li>
<li>Do we need to store any kind of metadata so that we know which entity every element
in each of the component vecs corresponds to?</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these things are *actually* one and the same.<br />
Because we store entities with *only* components <code>[T1, T2, T3]</code> in this archetype, the component 
vecs will always be the same length. This means that when we push components to the front of the vecs 
they'll all end up at the same index.</p>
<p>What we can do with this knowledge is have have a <code>Vec&lt;Entity&gt;</code> in the archetype and 
push the spawned <code>Entity</code> to the entities vec. We then have an implicit mapping where for every index in 
the component columns we can access the <code>entities</code> vec at the same index to check what entity this component is for. 
It's for the same reason that we can also access the other component columns at this index and the component will be for
the same entity.</p>
<p>That last point is why Query's in archetype based ECS' are *so* fast. When we want to iterate all <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> components
in our world we can just find every archetype that has a column for <code>T1</code> and also a column for <code>T2</code> and then blindly iterate
both Vecs at the same time. Some psuedocode to hopefully help demonstrate what I mean:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen">fn iterate_T1_and_T2(archetype: &amp;A_123) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = (&amp;T1, &amp;T2)&gt; {
  archetype.column_1.iter().zip(archetype.column_2.iter())
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that you (hopefully) have an understanding of how components get stored in archetype based ECS' and the performance
advantages we can get from it, it's time to talk about one of the biggest flaws of the archetype model. Adding/Removing components
is *really* slow.. like.. **really** slow.</p>
<p>Let's continue with our previous example of spawning our entity with components <code>[T1, T2, T3]</code>. It's sitting pretty comfortably in
our <code>A_123</code> archetype and we'll have super fast iteration times if we add more entities to this archetype and query for their components.</p>
<p>Now lets try adding a component to our entity. As previously mentioned our <code>A_123</code> archetype stores entities which *only* have 
<code>[T1, T2, T3]</code> components as this lets us have amazing iteration speeds. Now let's say we add a component <code>T4</code> to out entity, 
we would no longer fit this criteria which means we cant store our entity's components in <code>A_123</code>, we'll have to make a second archetype- 
<code>A_1234</code> it will store components for entities who only have <code>[T1, T2, T3, T4]</code></p>
<p>Lets write some quick psuedocode and see if the performance problem here speaks for itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplaypen">fn add_T4_to_entity_in_A_123(&amp;mut self, entity: Entity, data: T4) {
  let a_123 = /* magically get the A_123 archetype */;
  let index = /* magically get the index in the 
  component columns corresponding to the entity */;

  let a_1234 = /* magically get the A_1234 archetype */;

  a_1234.entities.push(entity);
  a_1234.column_4.push(data);

  // Oh no this doesnt look cheap at all
  a_1234.column_1.push(a_123.column_1.remove(index));
  a_1234.column_2.push(a_123.column_2.remove(index));
  a_1234.column_3.push(a_123.column_3.remove(index));

  self.archetypes.push(a_1234);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Aaaaaaaaand yep... we have to move all of the components out of the columns in <code>A_123</code>. We then have to 
push the removed component to our new archetype's columns. That's a lot of moving memory which isn't the 
fastest thing in the world- to say the least</p>
<p>There's not a whole lot we can do about this. The need to move all this memory around when adding/removing components is
entirely necessary for the previously mentioned amazing iteration performance. Archetype ECS' are inherently about trading in 
add/remove performance in exchange for iteration performance. </p>
<p>There are others ways to model your ECS such as sparsesets which have signficantly better add/remove performance
in exchange for worse iteration performance relative to archetype based ECS' (still fast though :P). There's no one 
best way to model an ECS, sparseset and archetype ECS' just make different tradeoffs :)</p>
